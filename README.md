Sure, here's a one-line description for each term mentioned in the deployment.yaml file:

1. KMS key in pagination: A cryptographic key managed by Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) used for encrypting and decrypting data related to pagination, likely for secure data handling in a paginated system.

2. KMS endpoint: The endpoint address (dns:///cloudkms.googleapis.com:443) where requests are sent for accessing Google Cloud KMS, which provides cryptographic services for managing keys and encrypting data.

3. Keyrings: Logical groupings within Google Cloud KMS used to organize cryptographic keys. They are typically used to manage and control access to multiple keys within a project or service.
