Goal1:
Over the last year, I have successfully delivered key projects including MBR Demat, AMPS, NBBL, Adapter, Issuer Switch Admin Transaction Utility Integration, and Payment Factory with a strong focus on quality and timely delivery. I consistently maintained sprint overrun rates well within the 10% threshold and ensured minimal defect leakage into SIT, staying below the severity one defect benchmark.

Additionally, I proactively tracked my work through JIRA task management, adhering to agile best practices and fostering a structured, transparent work culture. I consciously optimized the development process by reducing redundant efforts through smart, modular, and reusable coding practices — leading to better maintainability and reduced rework.

Through continuous learning and hands-on contribution, I ensured that escalations were either avoided or resolved efficiently, staying within the escalation limits set for the period. Overall, my approach balanced both hard work and smart, efficient delivery, contributing positively to the team’s performance and project outcomes.


Goal 2
I successfully implemented advanced technologies like gRPC, GCP Pub/Sub, Cloud Spanner, and Yugabyte Database, completing multiple POCs with detailed documentation. Developed generic utilities to enhance integration and reduce redundant effort. Maintained proper documentation and JIRA task tracking while continuously focusing on smart, efficient coding practices and contributing to the team’s technical growth.


Goal 3
I successfully designed and implemented the NBBL database, developed utilities for Aerospike including backup and restore operations, and performed detailed analysis and documentation of Issuer Switch tables.

Consistently delivered Payment Factory programs (AMPS, BMS, UPI Issuer Switch) with no major defects at the QA stage. Maintained high code quality while adhering to product architecture standards and JIRA task management. Focused on productivity, smart code practices, and continuous learning to strengthen my expertise in the banking domain.

Goal 4
I independently handled service deployments in OpenShift, managed Jenkins pipelines, and worked with Enterprise Quay and JFrog repositories. Successfully completed multiple cloud-related POCs on OpenShift and GCP, with proper documentation. Focused on optimizing deployment processes and improving delivery speed through smart, reusable scripts and configurations, while maintaining standard practices via JIRA task tracking and team collaboration.

Goal 5

I continuously enhanced my skills by practically implementing projects on SOAP, gRPC, Cloud Buckets, and other new technologies. Completed relevant Udemy courses to strengthen my technical knowledge. Actively created and reviewed Confluence pages to document project learnings, best practices, and technical findings, contributing to the team's knowledge base. Focused on both learning and applying new skills to real-time projects, ensuring consistent personal and professional growth.

Goal 6
I consistently maintained clear and streamlined communication with teammates, ensuring smooth coordination in daily tasks, sprint planning, and issue resolutions. Actively collaborated with stakeholders across the bank, gathering inputs and aligning technical solutions with business objectives. Fostered a positive, transparent work culture by managing JIRA tasks efficiently and ensuring timely updates and feedback within the team.
