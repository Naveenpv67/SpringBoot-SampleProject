I’ve already shared the complete TSD document and the database SQL schema with column lengths. I’ve also explained the comparison logic I need: please manually analyze both files and verify that each database column’s length is greater than or equal to the TSD specification. I don’t need Python code or instructions—I need you to run the check and give me a result showing which columns pass and which ones fail. Just do the verification for me directly.
