Objective 1: Successfully implemented interceptor using Spring Cloud API gateway to minimize code changes in the existing mobile banking application.
Measure: Reduced code changes by 30% within the specified timeline, resulting in smoother deployment and maintenance processes.

Objective 2: Conducted various proof of concepts (POCs) including Google PubSub integration, Docker image generation, and Java operations on Aerospike Database.
Measure: Completed a minimum of 5 POCs within the evaluation period, with each POC documented and shared with the team for future reference.

Certainly, here are simplified self-appraisals for the two goals provided:

Objective 1:
"I successfully implemented the interceptor using Spring Cloud API gateway, reducing code changes by 30% as planned. Overcame initial challenges through collaboration with the team, resulting in a smoother deployment process."

Objective 2:
"I conducted five proof of concepts, including Google PubSub integration and Docker image generation, documenting each for future reference. Demonstrated adaptability and innovation, contributing valuable insights to the team's projects."
