Got it, I understand now. Let's focus on comparing YugaByteDB and Cloud Spanner with PostgreSQL specifically:

| Aspect             | YugaByteDB                                 | PostgreSQL                                       | Cloud Spanner                                   |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Auto Sharding      | Automatically distributes data for scalability | Requires manual partitioning, providing more control | Automatically shards data for scalability      |
| Fault Tolerance    | Provides automatic replication and failover   | Requires manual configuration for replication and failover | Offers built-in replication and failover mechanisms |
| Global Distribution| Supports multi-region deployments           | Does not inherently support global distribution   | Offers built-in global distribution across regions |
| Compatibility      | Compatible with PostgreSQL APIs             | Compatible with PostgreSQL APIs                  | Offers strong SQL compatibility                 |
| Scalability        | Scales horizontally by adding more nodes    | Scales vertically by upgrading hardware          | Scales horizontally for increased capacity       |
| Performance        | Utilizes distributed architecture           | Relies on single-node architecture                | Utilizes distributed architecture               |
| Managed Service    | Not a managed service                      | Not a managed service                            | Managed service provided by Google Cloud         |
| Open Source        | Open-source                                | Open-source                                      | Not open-source                                 |

In the context of PostgreSQL, both YugaByteDB and Cloud Spanner offer advantages such as automatic sharding, fault tolerance, and global distribution, which PostgreSQL lacks. However, YugaByteDB may be more appealing if you prefer an open-source solution with compatibility with PostgreSQL APIs, while Cloud Spanner may offer stronger SQL compatibility and a managed service provided by Google Cloud. Consider factors such as your specific use case, budget, and preference for managed services when making your decision. Let me know if you need further clarification or assistance!
