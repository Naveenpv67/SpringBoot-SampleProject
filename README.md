### Goal 2: Database Management and Optimization (NBBL, AMPS, and Issuer Switch)  
Goal: Oversee the optimization and management of the NBBL database and contribute to the database design and implementation for AMPS. Potentially work on Issuer Switch database improvements based on the project needs.  
Measure:  
- Successful design and implementation of NBBL and AMPS databases.  
- Development of backup/restore utilities for Aerospike and database management utilities for AMPS.  
- Efficient issue switch database optimization, if applicable.  
Weightage: 20

### Goal 3: Cloud Infrastructure and Deployment (NBBL, AMPS, and OpenShift)  
Goal: Master cloud infrastructure processes and ensure smooth deployment of services in OpenShift for both NBBL and AMPS projects.  
Measure:  
- Independent deployment of services for NBBL and AMPS in OpenShift.  
- Completion of cloud-related POCs for the projects.  
- Ongoing monitoring and optimizing deployment pipelines using Jenkins.  
Weightage: 20

### Goal 4: Technical Excellence and Innovation (AMPS and NBBL)  
Goal: Lead the implementation of advanced technologies, such as gRPC, GCP Pub/Sub, Cloud Spanner, and Yugabyte Database, for both NBBL and AMPS projects.  
Measure:  
- Successful implementation of gRPC, GCP Pub/Sub, and Cloud Spanner within the projects.  
- Creation and documentation of generic utilities for better system integration.  
- Completion of all POCs and ensuring that they align with project requirements.  
Weightage: 15

### Goal 5: Continuous Learning and Development (NBBL, AMPS, and New Technologies)  
Goal: Continue enhancing skills through practical project implementation, completing relevant courses, and experimenting with new technologies for NBBL and AMPS.  
Measure:  
- Completion of Udemy courses related to NBBL and AMPS technologies.  
- Hands-on practical implementation of advanced topics such as SOAP, gRPC, and Cloud Buckets.  
- Documentation and review of project learnings in Confluence.  
Weightage: 15

### Goal 6: Team Communication and Collaboration (NBBL, AMPS, and Cross-Functional Teams)  
Goal: Improve communication and collaboration across NBBL, AMPS, and cross-functional teams (such as QA, stakeholders, and external vendors) to drive project success.  
Measure:  
- Streamlined communication and feedback loops between internal teams and external stakeholders (such as AMPS clients).  
- Effective collaboration with QA teams, ensuring timely issue resolution and minimal bugs in the projects.  
- Regular review and updates of JIRA tasks to keep teams aligned.  
Weightage: 10

### Key Highlights for 2025 & 2026:

1. NBBL will remain a critical focus as it continues to roll out live, with special attention on database optimization, cloud deployment, and streamlined processes.  
2. AMPS will be a major new initiative for 2025, with an emphasis on technological implementation, team collaboration, and project delivery.  
3. Potential work with Issuer Switch will be based on the needs of the projects, ensuring smooth coordination and database management across systems.
