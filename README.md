Payment API Requirements Document
1. Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a payment processing API that interacts with external systems (Flexcube and IBMB) and stores data in a database.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1. Request Processing
The API accepts payment requests in JSON format.

The request includes user ID, customer ID, account details, amount, and currency.

The API validates request data and returns an error for invalid inputs.

2.2. Flexcube Integration
The API interacts with Flexcube to initiate payment transactions.

Upon receiving a response from Flexcube, the API stores it in the database.

2.3. IBMB Integration
The API sends a notification to IBMB regarding payment initiation.

The API receives an acknowledgment response from IBMB and stores it in the database.

The API polls the database periodically for the final response from IBMB (up to 60 seconds).

2.4. Data Storage
The API stores the following data in the database:

Client payment request details

Flexcube response data (including status, error codes, and response data)

IBMB acknowledgment response data

IBMB final response data (including status, error codes, and response data)

2.5. Response Handling
The API returns a response to the client indicating the payment status (success, failure, pending).

The response includes details like transaction ID, amount, currency, and error messages (if applicable).

3. Technical Requirements
Programming Language: Java

Framework: Spring Boot

Database: Choose your preferred database (e.g., MongoDB)

External Systems: Flexcube, IBMB

APIs: Restful APIs for communication with external systems

Data Storage: Tables for storing payment requests, responses, and final results

4. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: Handle high transaction volumes efficiently.

Security: Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data.

Reliability: Ensure the API is resilient to failures.

Scalability: Design the API to scale with increasing workloads.

5. Sequence Diagram
[Insert a sequence diagram illustrating the flow of the payment process, including interactions with Flexcube and IBMB]

6. Data Flow Diagram
[Insert a data flow diagram showing data movement between the API, database, and external systems]

7. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
[Insert an ERD representing the database schema, including tables for payment requests, responses, and the master table]

8. Additional Considerations
Error Handling: Implement robust mechanisms to handle exceptions and provide informative error messages.

Logging: Track the request and response flow through logging.

Testing: Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for API functionality and reliability.

Documentation: Provide clear API documentation with usage instructions, parameters, and expected responses.

Detailed Breakdown of Requirements
8.1. Core Components
Flexcube: Core banking system for payment processing.

IBMB: Third-party system involved in the payment process.

Database: Stores payment request, response, and master data.

Payment Processor: Manages payment logic and interacts with Flexcube and IBMB.

8.2. Tables
ClientPaymentRequestTable: Stores details about incoming payment requests (request ID, user ID, customer ID, amount, currency, etc.).

FlexcubeResponseTable: Stores the response received from Flexcube (status, error codes, response data).

IBMBAcknowledgmentTable: Stores the acknowledgment response from IBMB (status, reference ID).

IBMBResponseTable: Stores the final response from IBMB (status, error codes, response data).

MasterTable: Stores the final payment status, result, and details from all steps:

Request data (foreign key to ClientPaymentRequestTable)

Flexcube response data

IBMB acknowledgment response data

IBMB final response data

Final status (success, failure, pending)

Final result

Error details (if applicable)

Timestamps for each stage

8.3. Data Flow
Client sends a payment request to the API.

The API validates the request and forwards it to the payment processor.

The payment processor calls Flexcube with the request payload.

Flexcube processes the request and sends a response.

The payment processor stores the Flexcube response in the database.

The payment processor notifies IBMB about the payment initiation.

IBMB sends an acknowledgment response, which the API stores in the database.

The API polls the database for the final response from IBMB.

The final response from IBMB is stored in the database.

The API returns the final payment status to the client.
