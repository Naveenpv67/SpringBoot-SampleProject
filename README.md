Hi Master, I'm a 5 years experienced backend developer and I'm working in a bank. So, I have joined and it's almost 8 months past. So, now I have to fill my self performance appraisal form. So, I have listed all my contributions to the bank. In 8 months that I have listed down. So, I need your help to fill the performance self appraisal using various aspects. So, we have an employee portal to fill those. So, I will give the points. Please make a note on that and help me to do and help me to fill the self appraisal form. Hope you will help me.



I have wrote java code to analyze the complete mobile banking database i.e. MBR database. I have implemented interceptor using Spring Cloud API gateway to minimize the code changes of existing mobile banking application. I have learnt Nginx configuration like how to pass the proxy based on the URL. I have learnt how to code in Nginx server like executing the if-else so that I can route the request dynamically and conditionally. I have migrated interceptor logic from Spring Boot API gateway to Nginx. I have learnt how to do query operations in user-specific database using java. If I am new to Golang also, I have learnt to Golang completely using the Udemy course and practical executions. I have explored mobile banking code which is in Golang. I have debugged and understood completely. I have implemented encryption and decryption logic in java for the interceptor project. Mainly I have spent a lot of time on Giga dev server setup. While DevOps deployed the pods, still there was many issues like database data issue, connectivity to other modules like common services etc. So I have debugged and solved it by analyzing the how to port bind in ASM, how to configure the frame charts, how to configure and analyze successive DB insert scripts.

POCs I have done a lot of POCs like Google PubSub using Spring Boot Second Generating and running Docker images for Go services and also how to pass environment variables or runtime arguments to that Docker image Javaspec DB and next is Javaspec DB operations with Java code for various operations like how to extract the maximum or biggest load in a set etc. Next point I have explored how to take the backup and restore of Javaspec database for entire database or single set like this I have done various POCs and explorations and also that has been properly documented for future purpose and also it will be helpful for the team I have explored entire conference and finally got the Javaspec of complete Mobile Banking MBA project and documented in conference and also shared it to team I have wrote JUnit test cases using Mockito and tested the code coverage using Zakapo Related to payment factory I have integrated mixed gateways like seamless integration and also I have integrated cyber source seamless integration using APIs by generating the HMAC signature and digest
